# OSI Model Visualization Tool  

## Introduction to OSI Model  

The **Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model** is a conceptual framework that standardizes network communication into **seven layers**. Each layer has a specific role and depends on the layer below it for data transmission. Understanding these layers helps in **troubleshooting networks, designing protocols, and improving security**.  

This tool provides an **interactive way to visualize** how data packets move through the OSI layers, from the **Application Layer (Layer 7)** down to the **Physical Layer (Layer 1)**.

## üîç Understanding OSI Layers  

| Layer | Function | Example Protocols |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **7. Application** | User interaction with the network | HTTP, FTP, SMTP |
| **6. Presentation** | Data encryption, compression | SSL/TLS, JPEG, MPEG |
| **5. Session** | Maintains sessions between devices | NetBIOS, RPC |
| **4. Transport** | Reliable delivery (TCP/UDP) | TCP, UDP |
| **3. Network** | Routing and addressing | IP, ICMP |
| **2. Data Link** | MAC addressing and framing | Ethernet, Wi-Fi |
| **1. Physical** | Hardware transmission | Cables, Radio Signals |
